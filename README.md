# trilium-md2org
A python script to convert my Trilium notes export to org documents

I mainly made this to convert all my trilium notes markdown export to org files so that I can use them with Emacs, since org is better. But it can be used to convert any markdown file to org file.

Download trilium-md2doc.py

$ chmod +x trilium_md2org.py
$ ./trilium_md2org.py /path/to/md /path/to/org
